Revistited this later in the week. With that said habits that I want to reproduce daily are the following:
Use turing's resouces for questions of any kind.
Try to manage the time spent on a singluar problem. If I come across an issue that I can't troubleshoot revisit it.
Use keyboard short cuts more often then mouse input.
